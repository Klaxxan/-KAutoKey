# -KAutoKey
Auto Key Presser app built with Python and Tkinter.

---

Have you ever wanted OP Autoclicker but for your keyboard? Well this is it right here!

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A PRESSER NOT HOLDER IT PRESSES THE KEYS SLOWLY OR EXTREMELY FAST THATS NOT EQUIVALENT TO HOLDING DOWN A KEY!!! AKA GAMES LIKE ROBLOX 'SHIFT + W' WILL NOT MAKE YOUR CHARACTER SPRINT! BUT IF YOU JUST DO 'W' IT WILL MAKE YOUR PLAYER WALK! 

I may add an hold function in the future but for now its not in my top priority :)

Version 1.2 Update
- Fixed not being able to change toggle keybind
- Minor code improvements

I.. Cant believe it I forgot to put the most basic key in.. space how did I forget the spacebar.. Uh yeah update soon adding space to the list of keys you can auto press (I just forgot to list the key in the dropdown) :( 

It's already done but its 10 AM and I havent slept till yesterday (working on a new project) and I couldn't be bother to make it an exe put it into an installer and then upload the update here rn so.. tomorrow update
